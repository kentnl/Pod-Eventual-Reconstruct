# NAME

Pod::Eventual::Reconstruct - Construct a document from Pod::Eventual events

# VERSION

version 0.1.1

# SYNOPSIS

Constructing a Document from a series of Pod::Eventual events is not hard, its just slightly nuanced,
and there's a few small pitfalls for people who want input == output consistency.

This module simply implements the basic layers of edge-cases to make that simpler.

## Construct the reconstructor

    # Write to $string
    my $string;
    my $recon = Pod::Eventual::Reconstruct->string_writer( $string )
    # or
    my $recon = Pod::Eventual::Reconstruct->string_writer( \$string )
    # ( both work )

    # Write to $file
    my $recon = Pod::Eventual::Reconstruct->file_writer( $file )

    # Write to file in utf8 mode
    my $recon = Pod::Eventual::Reconstruct->file_writer_utf8( $file )

    # Write to filehandle
    my $recon = Pod::Eventual::Reconstruct->handle_writer_utf8( $handle )

## Send Events to it

    $recon->write_event( $hashref_from_pod_elemental )

# METHODS

## string\_writer

Create a reconstructor that writes to a string

    my $reconstructor = ::Reconstruct->string_writer( $string )
    my $reconstructor = ::Reconstruct->string_writer( \$string )

## file\_writer

Create a reconstructor that writes to a file

    my $reconstructor = ::Reconstruct->file_writer( $file_name )

Values of `Path::Tiny` or `Path::Class` should also work as values of `$file_name`

## file\_writer\_raw

Create a reconstructor that writes to a file in raw mode

    my $reconstructor = ::Reconstruct->file_writer_raw( $file_name )

Values of `Path::Tiny` or `Path::Class` should also work as values of `$file_name`

## file\_writer\_utf8

Create a reconstructor that writes to a file in `utf8` mode

    my $reconstructor = ::Reconstruct->file_writer_utf8( $file_name )

Values of `Path::Tiny` or `Path::Class` should also work as values of `$file_name`

## handle\_writer

Create a reconstructor that writes to a file handle

    my $reconstructor = ::Reconstruct->handle_writer( $handle )

## write\_event

Write a [`Pod::Eventual`](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Pod::Eventual) event of any kind to the output target.

    $recon->write_event( $eventhash );

Note: This is just a proxy for the other methods which delegates based on the value of `$eventhash->{type}`.

Unknown `type`'s will cause errors.

## write\_command

Write a  [`Pod::Eventual`](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Pod::Eventual) `command` event.

`$event->{type}` __MUST__ be `eq 'command'`

    $recon->write_command({ type => 'command', ... });

## write\_text

Write a  [`Pod::Eventual`](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Pod::Eventual) `text` event.

`$event->{type}` __MUST__ be `eq 'text'`

    $recon->write_text({ type => 'text', ... });

## write\_nonpod

Write a  [`Pod::Eventual`](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Pod::Eventual) `nonpod` event.

`$event->{type}` __MUST__ be `eq 'nonpod'`

    $recon->write_nonpod({ type => 'nonpod', ... });

## write\_blank

Write a  [`Pod::Eventual`](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Pod::Eventual) `blank` event.

`$event->{type}` __MUST__ be `eq 'blank'`

    $recon->write_blank({ type => 'blank', ... });

# ATTRIBUTES

## write\_handle

    "namespace":"Pod::Eventual::Reconstruct",
    "inherits": "Moo::Object"
